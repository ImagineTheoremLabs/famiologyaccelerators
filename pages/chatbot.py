            I am using sqlite3 database for the given question.
            Consider that there can be spelling mistakes involved in the questions regarding the name of the facutal data present 
            so consider that and give me a command for this.
            Dont add additional text just give me commands.
            usually when user asks question it mentions name in a format such as First Name and Last Name.
            Try to add all the conditions in the command so that it wont give the incorrect data.
